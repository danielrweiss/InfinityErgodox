If you're having issues with vash.input.club url not loading a default layout json file for the Infinity Ergodox Kiibohd Configurator do the following:

* View -> Toggle Developer Tools
* Click Settings, you should see in the advanced window the vash.input.club link as the placeholder option for Base Uri
* Paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielrweiss/InfinityErgodox/refs/heads/main`
* Go back to home page and click the Infinity Ergodox, which should load the default json file and get you into the configuration window
